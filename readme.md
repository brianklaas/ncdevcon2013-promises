This project contains the code examples used in my presentation "Promises, Promises: Unlocking the Power of jQueryâ€™s Deferreds" given at NCDevCon 2013.

You will need to have your browser console open to see the result of many of these files.

While most of the files contain fully working examples, the following contain fragments only:

* 2-badSetTimeout.html
* 3-badCounters.html
* 4-badPyramid.html
* 22-peristenceAdapters.txt
* 23-qCreditCardExample.txt

To see how 21-checkLongRunningProcess.html works, simply change the text in appLongRunningExample.txt from "done" to something else and then back to "done" when you want the process to finish.
